# Welcome to Onyxia's Lair!

This is a text-based JavaScript game that I developed as a solo project. You and the boss both start at 50 HP and you have a choice between 3 different kinds of attacks: Normal, Power, and Defensive.

Normal balances damage dealt to you and to Onyxia.
Power has the potential for higher damage dealt to Onyxia, but also leaves you more vulnerable.
Defensive raises your shields and reducing your incoming damage as well as your damage dealt.

Can YOU defeat Onyxia, the Black Dragon?!
